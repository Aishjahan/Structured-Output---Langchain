📁 Structured-Output---Langchain
-------------------------------------------

This repo is all about generating **structured output** from language models using **LangChain**, especially when working with Hugging Face models.

### 🎯 Why use structured output?

Using structured outputs helps in:

*   ✅ Validating the output from a language model.
    
*   ⚙️ Automating tasks like filling forms, updating databases, calling APIs, etc.
    
*   🤖 Making real-world applications smarter and more reliable.
    

🧪 Covered Methods:
-------------------

### 🟩 1. **Pydantic-Based Structured Output** (with\_structured\_output\_pydantic.py)

*   Uses **Pydantic** (a Python library) to define schemas.
    
*   Good for **type checking** and **validating data**.
    

**Note:** Some HuggingFace models (especially chat models) may not support this method properly.

### 🟦 2. **TypedDict-Based Structured Output** (with\_structured\_output\_typeddict.py)

*   Uses Python’s built-in TypedDict to define schemas.
    
*   Does **not** check the data at runtime but still helps organize it.
    
    

Use this when you want structured output but don’t need strict validation.

### 🟨 3. **JSON Schema-Based Structured Output** (with\_structured\_output\_json.py)

*   The most compatible method when working with Hugging Face models.
        
*   Works great with models like "sarvamai/sarvam-m".
